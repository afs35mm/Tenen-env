        <h3>Experience</h3>

<p>Several of our recent projects are described below.</p>

<h4>Affordable Housing Site – Brooklyn, New York</h4>
<p>
Tenen supervised the removal of petroleum-impacted soils connected with a
4,800-gallon fuel tank UST and conducted a supplemental soil and groundwater
investigation to identify groundwater impacts related to residual contamination.
Using a sonic drill rig, a soil boring was advanced through glacial till to 70 feet
below grade, with continuous sampling, followed by well installation and sampling.
An investigation report was submitted to NYSDEC in September 2011. Tenen also
provided NYSDEC with a Spill Closure Report, incorporating a vapor barrier, sub-
slab depressurization system (SSDS), and composite cover system. The spill was
closed by NYSDEC in September 2011 and Tenen is currently overseeing installation
of the SSDS.
</p>
<h4>NYSDEC Spill Site/NYC “e” Designation Site – Far West Side, Manhattan</h4>
<p>
Working with a local developer, Tenen reviewed the existing reports for two
properties with open spills and worked with the client’s attorney to develop a
regulatory strategy to address the requirements of the NYSDEC Spills Program
and the New York City “e” designation. At the client’s request, Tenen prepared
a preliminary remedial cost estimate encompassing the following: chipping,
removal and disposal of petroleum-impacted bedrock; removal/disposal of recycled
concrete; dewatering and disposal of impacted groundwater during construction;
and design and installation of a vapor barrier.
</p>
<h4>NYC “e” Designation Site – West Chelsea, Manhattan</h4>
<p>
Tenen helped a Chelsea art gallery to address the hazardous materials “e”
designation from an area-wide rezoning. The client planned to construct an
art gallery addition directly under the High Line Park. Tenen worked with the
Mayor’s Office of Environmental Remediation (OER) to develop a remedial
investigation work plan for the property; conducted a soil, groundwater and soil
gas investigation; and prepared the Remedial Investigation Report and Remedial
Action Plan. Remediation consists of excavation and removal of soils above the
established soil cleanup objectives (SCOs), end point sampling; and design and
installation of a composite cover and vapor barrier. Tenen worked with the
client’s architect to incorporate the vapor barrier into the foundation design and
performed soil disposal characterization sampling. A Notice to Proceed was issued
by OER in December 2011. Tenen is currently providing remedial oversight during
construction and will prepare the Remedial Closure Report.
</p>
<h4>Due Diligence Assessments – Brooklyn, New York</h4>
<p>
For a national non-profit organization, Tenen performed Phase I and II due diligence
activities for a building housing a mental health outpatient clinic. Based on the
historic operations in the area and the potential presence of a former gasoline
tank beneath the adjoining sidewalk, Tenen recommended a soil and soil gas
investigation within the building to identify potential environmental obstacles
to site redevelopment. Soil borings and soil vapor points were installed in the
basement and active areas of the building using a limited access geoprobe. The
sample results were compared with appropriate regulatory guidance levels and
incorporated into a report for client review.
</p>
<h4>School Facility – Borough Park, Brooklyn</h4>
<p>
Tenen coordinated with OER to determine the requirements necessary to
retroactively satisfy the hazardous materials and air quality “e” designations placed
on the property. After negotiating a work plan with OER, Tenen conducted a soil
vapor, indoor air and ambient air investigation at the property and is currently
preparing a report for OER detailing the results. The air quality “E” designation
placed on the Site requires that natural gas be used for heating. Since the HVAC
system for the Site building currently uses electrical units, and no natural gas use
is anticipated, Tenen prepared a letter and supporting documentation to address
the air quality “e” requirements and provide justification to support the usage of
electrical units.
</p>
<p>
Phase I Environmental Site Assessments. Tenen has performed multiple property
assessments to satisfy “e” designation requirements and/or for use in property
transactions. Examples include the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
An undeveloped property in Yonkers, New York, under consideration as
an affordable housing site; work included Phase I site assessment and
supervision of test pitting to identify soil characteristics and potential
contamination due to historic operations.
</li>
<li>
Due diligence work, including a Phase I site assessment and a soil boring
program, associated with a parking lot in north Manhattan planned for future
hotel development.
</li>
<li>
A downtown Brooklyn property due diligence Phase I to aid a non-profit
organization in determining the site’s viability as a future New York City
headquarters location.
</li>
</ul>
